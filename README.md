MNet: an R package for integrative analysis of metabolomics and transcriptomics

## Overview of Workflow
MNet: an R package for integrative analysis of metabolomics and transcriptomics  
The package is designed for mining metabolomics alongside transcriptomic data with three key features: 1) its built-in ‘dbMNet’ providing an expert-curated knowledgebase for metabolomics, which includes all currently available gene-metabolite and metabolite-metabolite interactions in humans; 2) its advanced analytical capabilities supporting extended pathway enrichment analysis, extended differential abundance analysis, and extended pathway set enrichment analysis to identify dysregulated metabolic pathways via considering both metabolites and genes; 3) its unique capabilities for metabolic-related subnetwork analysis, offering a systems-level understanding of metabolic interconnections.
